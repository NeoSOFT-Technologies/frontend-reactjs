### React-scripts	
 It a set of scripts from the create-react-app starter pack. create-react-app helps you kick off projects without configuring, so you do not have to setup your project by yourself. react-scripts start sets up the development environment and starts a server, as well as hot module reloading.
### Installation
**With npm:**

`npx create-react-app my-app`

**cd my-app**

**npm start**

It will create a directory called my-app inside the current folder.
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:
```
my-app
├── README.md
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── .gitignore
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html
│   └── manifest.json
└── src
    ├── App.css
    ├── App.js
    ├── App.test.js
    ├── index.css
    ├── index.js
    ├── logo.svg
    └── serviceWorker.js
    └── setupTests.js
```
 
No configuration or complicated folder structures, only the files you need to build your app.
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder
