`React Helmet` is a component to dynamically manage the document’s head section. Some common use cases include setting the title, description, and meta tags for the document.

When combined with server-side rendering, it allows you to set meta tags that will be read by search engines and social media crawlers. This makes server-side rendering and React Helmet a powerful combination for creating apps that can benefit from SEO (search engine optimization) and social media data like oEmbed, Facebook Open Graph, or Twitter Cards.
