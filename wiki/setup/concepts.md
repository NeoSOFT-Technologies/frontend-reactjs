# Concepts

## 1. Component
### 1. Class Component
   
      a.constructor
      b.state and props
      c.lifecyle methods(componentDidMount,componentDidUpdate,etc)
      d.render
      e.export class component
   
### 2. Functional Component
   
      a. props
      b. useState
      c. useEffect
      d. useRef
      e. return
      f. export function component
   
## 2. React Hooks 
   
      a. useState (react)
      b. useref (react)
      c. useEffect (react)
      d. useLocation (react-router-dom)
      e. useNavigate (react-router-dom)
      f. useParams (react-router-dom)
      g. useSelector (react-redux)
      h. useDispatch (react-redux)
   

## 3. Redux

   a. actions :- ( Actions have a type field that tells what kind of action to perform and all other fields contain 
                  information or data. in "src/app/redux/actions" folder contains files with redux actions)
                  
   b. reducer :- (a reducer is a pure function that takes an action and the previous state of the application and
                  returns the new state. in "src/app/redux/reducers" contains file with reducer functions)
                  
   c. store :-    ("src/app/redux/store" contains a file in which store is created.)
   
   d. createStore :-  (a method used to create a storage space where data would be stored and provided to application)
   
   e. combineReducers :- (method used to combine multiple reducers)
   
   f. Provider  :-  (a component which works as a wrapper for other components where redux storage needs 
                     to be accessed by any component not encapsulated inside this wrapper would not be able 
                     to access redux storage.)
                     
   g. useSelector,useDispatch :-  (hooks used in function components to access and manipulate redux storage)

   h. useAppSelector,useAppDispatch :- (custom hooks created for the Project with the help of useSelector and useDispatch)
    


## 4. Redux Toolkit
The Redux core library is deliberately unopinionated. It lets you decide how you want to handle everything, like store setup, what your state contains, and how you want to build your reducers.

## 5. React-Router-Dom

   a.BrowserRouter      (a component which works as a wrapper for other components which use routing in react)
   
   b.Routes       (a Routes component is similar to a "switch" statement in many programming languages ,    
                  it switches between components according to route path, hence it encapsulates all components 
                  which need to be switched between each other.)
                  
   c.Route         (it defines a particular path for a component to be displayed in react-dom)
   
   e.useLocation   (hook used to access location and data passed through previous component)
   
   f.useNavigate   (hook used to navigate )
   
   g.Navigate (a component used to navigate through react-dom)
   
   h.Link (a component used to navigate through react-dom)

## 6. React-Bootstrap

   a.React-Bootstrap Components     
   b.inline styling   
   c.bootstrap classes

## 7. Bootstrap 

   a.bootstrap components   
   b.bootstrap classes


## 8. Regular Expression
   
   a.create a regular expression   
   b.test data against regular
   

## 9. Axios

   a.GET,POST,PUT,DELETE requests  
   b.headers      
   c.params   
   d.query   
   e.request body

## 10.Sass

   a. preprocessing
   b. using variables
   c. nesting
   d. partials
   e. modules
   f. extend/inheritance
   g. operators
   h. mixins

## 11. React-toastify :-
   The React-Toastify package allows the developer to show toasts to display a message and piece of information to the user for a certain period of time.
## 12. Reuseable Components :- 
   (These components are like a template which can be used multiple times in our project and used with props to pass data into it.)

## 13. Environmental files :- 
   (these files are used to store sensitive data like certain tokens and PORT numbers, connection links ,etc.)
   Apart from the main env file there are further segregation such as :-
   a. env.production - Used to create the environment variables in production phase.
   b. env.staging - Used to create the environment variables in staging phase.
   c. env.test - Used to create the environment variables in Testing phase.
   d. env.development - Used to create the environment variables in Development phase, if not present it will by default use the `.env` file present.
