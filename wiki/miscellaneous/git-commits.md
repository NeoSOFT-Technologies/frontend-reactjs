# Git commits and pre hooks

We have added some git pre hooks while committing the code. These pre hooks are executed on every git commit.

## What is commitlint

[Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) checks if your commit messages meet the [conventional commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

Commit message can be bifurcated into 3 section "<Type>(<Module/Scope>): <Commit_Message>"

Type: can be anyone of them feat | bugfix | feature etc.

> Module/Scope: Module/Scope is the name of the module you are working on

Commit_Message: Actual commit message

``` git commit -m "feat(documentation): adding documentation" ```

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- **chore**: Updating tasks etc; no production code change
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **sample**: A change to the samples
